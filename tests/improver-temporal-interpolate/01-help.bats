                                     INFILES INFILES

Interpolate data between validity times

positional arguments:
  INFILES               Files contain the data at the beginning and end of the
                        period (2 files required).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --interval_in_mins INTERVAL_IN_MINS
                        Specifies the interval in minutes at which to
                        interpolate between the two input cubes. A number of
                        minutes which does not divide up the interval equally
                        will raise an exception. If intervals_in_mins is set
                        then times can not be set.
  --times TIMES [TIMES ...]
                        Specifies the times in the format {YYYYMMDD}T{HHMM}Z
                        at which to interpolate between the two input
                        cubes.Where {YYYYMMDD} is year, month day and {HHMM}
                        is hour and minutes e.g 20180116T0100Z. More than one
                        timecan be provided separated by a space but if times
                        are set interval_in_mins can not be set
  --output_files OUTPUT_FILES [OUTPUT_FILES ...]
                        List of output files. The interpolated files will
                        always be in the chronological order of earliest to
                        latest regardless of the order of the infiles.
