    Regrids fields onto the standard grid

    Inputs
    -------
    field : cube
        cube to be regridded onto Standard_Grid
    grid : string
        the grid we wish to interpolate to

    Exceptions
    -----------
    - Raises a ValueError if NaNs are found in the field following regridding
        (this would indicate the input field domain was smaller than the
         standard grid) UNLESS: grid is global field.
